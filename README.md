# LOTL-LAN 🦀 (v1.9.57)

**LOTL-LAN** is a tactical internal network monitoring and threat intelligence suite designed to detect **Living off the Land** (LOTL) attack vectors within a Local Area Network. 

By focusing on East-West traffic and protocol-specific anomalies (LLMNR, NBNS, MDNS, ARP), LOTL-LAN provides security analysts with real-time visibility into lateral movement and internal poisoning attempts.



## 🚀 Key Features

* **Active Threat Intelligence**: Automatically analyzes protocol frequency for lateral pivot patterns and escalates alerts to the System Security Status window.
* **East-West Threat Window**: A dedicated, scrollable log that deduplicates and tracks unique internal connection strings.
* **Protocol Decoder**: Deep-dive intelligence on discovery protocols used in NTLM relay and spoofing attacks.
* **Tactical HUD**: 
    * **5s Stabilized Refresh**: Zero-flicker UI for high-stress monitoring environments.
    * **CSV Export**: One-click forensic documentation of all discovered threats.
    * **Security Status Grid**: Real-time health monitoring of ARP, Scanning, and Host-based decoys.

## 🛠️ Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
* **Python 3.9+**
